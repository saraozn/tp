### 3.1 Architecture
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delcust 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Customer` object residing in the `Model`.

### 3.3 Logic component
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delcust 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delcust 1` Command](images/DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCustomerCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a customer).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCustomerCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCustomerCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCustomerCommandParser`, `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 3.4 Model component
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Customer` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCustomerList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Customer` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Customer>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Customer` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Customer` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### 3.5 Storage component
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Internal implementations of Customer and Property
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### 4.1.1 Customer
The structure of a `Customer` object can be viewed in the object diagram below.

![CustomerObjectDiagram](images/CustomerObjectDiagram.png)

From the diagram, the `Customer` object consists of the following attributes.
- `Name`: The name of the customer.
- `Phone`: The phone number of the customer.
- `Email`: The email address of the customer.
- `Budget`: The budget that the customer is willing to pay for the property.
- `Tags`: The characteristics of the property that the customer is looking for.

#### 4.1.2 Property
The structure of a `Property` object can be viewed in the object diagram below.

![PropertyObjectDiagram](images/PropertyObjectDiagram.png)

From the diagram, the `Property` object consists of the following attributes.
- `PropName`: The name of the property.
- `PropAddress`: The address of the property.
- `PropPhone`: The phone number of the property.
- `Price`: The price of the property.
- `Tags`: The characteristics of the property that the customer is looking for.

#### 4.1.3 User input validation
Phone numbers both follow this validation regex.
```
public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = "(6|8|9)\\d{7}";
```
This means that phone numbers must start with 6, 8, or 9 and must have at least 8 digits. This means it only supports Singapore phone numbers.

<br>

`Price` and `Budget` follow this validation regex.
```
public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = "[1-9]\\d{4,11}";
```
This means that the price or budget must be a positive integer with at least 5 digits and at most 12 digits. It also cannot start with 0.

We decided on this arbitrary limit because we thought that it is not possible for a property to cost less than 10,000 dollars. We also thought that it is not possible for a property to cost more than 1 trillion dollars.

### 4.2 Adding of customers and properties
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### 4.2.1 Customers
The customer list should not allow duplicate customers to be added. This is because it is not possible for a customer to have two profiles. This means we need to define a condition to check if the customer is already in the list.

At the start, we used a customer's `Name` to check if he was a duplicate entry. However, we realised that two unique customers may have the same names. Therefore, we decided to use the customer's `Phone` number to check if he was a duplicate entry. This is because it is unlikely for two unique customers to have the same phone number.

The activity diagram for the creation of a customer can be seen below.
![AddCustomerActivityDiagram](images/AddCustomerActivityDiagram.png)

#### 4.2.2 Properties
Similar to the customer list, the property list should not allow duplicate properties to be added as well. This is because it will cause bugs in our other features. This means we need to define a condition to check if the property is already in the list.

At the start, we used a property's `Name` to check if he was a duplicate entry. However, we realised that two unique properties may have the same names. Therefore, we decided to use the property's `Address` to check if he was a duplicate entry. This is because it is unlikely for two unique properties to have the same address.

The activity diagram for the creation of a property can be seen below.
![AddPropertyActivityDiagram](images/AddPropertyActivityDiagram.png)

### 4.3 Editing of buyers and properties
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### 4.3.1 Motivation
The property agent may want to edit the details of a customer or property after adding it to the application. For example, the property agent may want to change the budget range of a customer after adding it to PropertyMatch.
Or, the property agent may want to change the budget of a property after adding it to PropertyMatch.

#### 4.3.2 Implementation
The `EditCustomerCommand` and `EditPropertyCommand` classes extends the `Command` class. They are used to edit the details of a customer or property, respectively.
Both commands allow the user to change any of the fields of a customer or property. The commands expect at least one flag to be edited, otherwise an error message will be displayed.
When the edit command is inputted, the `EditCustomerCommandParser` and `EditPropertyCommandParser` classes are used to parse the user input and create the respective `EditCustomerCommand` and `EditPropertyCommand` objects.
When these created command objects are executed by the `LogicManager`, the `EditCustomerCommand#execute(Model model)` or `EditPropertyCommand#execute(Model model)` methods are called. These methods will edit the customer or property in the model, and return a `CommandResult` object.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:exclamation: **Note:**
To be more concise, we will be referring to both customers and properties as entities in this section from here onwards.
</div>

During this execution process, the existing entity is first retrieved from the model. The fields of the entities are then edited according to what flags were passed in by the user during the edit commands.
A new customer or property is then created with the edited fields, and any fields that have not been edited will be copied over from the original entity. The new entity is then added to the model, and the original entity is removed from the model.
The new customer or property is then added into the model, replacing the old one. The new entity will then be displayed to the user, and a success message is displayed.

#### 4.3.3 Design Considerations
**Aspect: How the edit commands should relate to each other:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `EditCustomerCommand` and `EditPropertyCommand` are separate, and both inherit from the `Command` class.
    * Pros:
        * Both the `Customer` and `Property` classes have different fields that are exclusive to each other.
        * This reduces complexity of the system, and unexpected behaviours.
        * The inheritance of the `Command` class allows us to keep to the Command design pattern, to easily add more types of edit commands in the future, without having to change the existing code.
    * Cons:
        * More boilerplate code for each of the classes, which increases the size of the codebase.
* **Alternative 2:** A single `EditCommand` class is used to edit both customer and property.
    * Cons:
        * Unnecessary complexity is introduced into the system.

**Aspect: How the edited entities should interact with the model:**
* We also decided for the edit commands to create a new entity, instead of editing the existing one. This allows us to not include any setters in the `Customer` and `Property` classes, which make the objects immutable, so there is less likelihood of unexpected changes to the object. This enables us to maintain the defensiveness of our code.
  By creating a new entity every time the property agent edits, we can easily add the new customer or property into the model, and remove the old one. This also allows us to easily undo the edit command in the future, by simply adding the old entity back into the model.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `EditCustomerCommand` is executed.

![EditCustomerSequenceDiagram](images/EditCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `EditPropertyCommand` is executed.

![EditPropertySequenceDiagram](images/EditPropertySequenceDiagram.png)
### 4.4 Deleting of customers and properties
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### 4.4.1 Motivation
The property agent may want to delete the profile of any customer or property that has been previously added into the app. For example, the property agent might want to remove a particular property after it has been sold.
Or, a particular client is no longer interested in buying a house anymore.

#### 4.4.2 Implementation
The `DeleteCustomerCommand` and `DeletePropertyComannd` classes extends from the `Command` class. They are used to delete the details of a Customer or Property respectively. The command expects exactly one `INDEX` of the Customer or Property to be deleted, otherwise an error message will be displayed.
When the delete command is inputted, the `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` and `DeletePropertyCommandParser` classes are used to parse the user input and create the `DeleteCustomerCommand` or `DeletePropertyCommand` objects respectively.

When these created command objects are executed by the `LogicManager`, the `DeleteCustomerCommand#execute(Model model)` or `DeletePropertyCommand#execute(Model model)` methods are called. These methods will delete the customer or property in the model, and return a `CommandResult` object.

#### 4.4.3 Design Considerations
**Aspect: How the delete commands should relate to each other:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `DeleteCustomerCommand` and `DeletePropertyCommand` are separate, and both inherit from the `Command` class.


* **Alternative 2:** A single `DeleteCommand` class is used to edit both customer and property.
    * Cons:
        * Unnecessary complexity is introduced into the system.

The following activity diagram summarises the execution of a `delcust INDEX` command.

![DeleteCustomerActivityDiagram](images/DeleteCustomerActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `DeleteCustomerCommand` is executed.

![DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `DeletePropertyCommand` is executed.

![DeletePropertySequenceDiagram](images/DeletePropertySequenceDiagram.png)

### 4.5 Finding of Customers and Properties
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### 4.5.1 Motivation
The property agent may want to find and access the details of a particular Customer or Property that has been previously added into the app. For example, the property agent may want to refresh their memory on a particular customer's budget. Or the property agent may want to check the details of a particular property.

#### 4.5.2 Implementation
The `FindCustomerCommand` and `FindPropertyCommand` classes extends the `Command` class. They are used to find the profiles of a customer or property, respectively.
Both commands allow the user to find any customer or property. The commands expect at least one substring to base the search on, otherwise an error message will be displayed.

When the find command is inputted, the `FindCustomerCommandParser` and `FindPropertyCommandParser` classes are used to parse the user input and create the respective `FindCustomerCommand` and `FindPropertyCommand` objects.
When these created command objects are executed by the `LogicManager`, the `FindCustomerCommand#execute(Model model)` or `FindPropertyCommand#execute(Model model)` methods are called. These methods will find the customer or property in the model, and return a `CommandResult` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `FindCustomerCommand` is executed.
![FindCustomerSequenceDiagram](images/FindCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 4.5.3 Design Considerations
**Aspect: How the find commands should relate to each other:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `FindCustomerCommand` and `FindPropertyCommand` are separate, and both inherit from the `Command` class.
    * Pros:
        * Both the `Customer` and `Property` classes have different fields that are exclusive to each other.
        * This reduces complexity of the system, and unexpected behaviours.
        * The inheritance of the `Command` class allows us to keep to the Command design pattern, to easily add more types of edit commands in the future, without having to change the existing code.
    * Cons:
        * More boilerplate code for each of the classes, which increases the size of the codebase.
* **Alternative 2:** A single `FindCommand` class is used to find both customer and property.
    * Cons:
        * Unnecessary complexity is introduced into the system.

### 4.6 Filtering of Customers and Properties
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### 4.6.1 Motivation
The property agent may want to see a list of customers based on their budget. For example, the property agent may want to filter customers with budget more than $100000.
Or, the property agent may want to see a list of customers based on the characteristics of the property they desired. For example, the property agent may want to filter customers who love pink properties.
Or, the property agent may want to see a list of customers based on both budget and characteristics to enhance productivity.

The property agent may also want to see a list of properties based on their budget. For example, the property agent may want to filter properties with budget less than $1000000.
Or, the property agent may want to see a list of properties based on the characteristics. For example, the property agent may want to filter pink properties.
Or, the property agent may want to see a list of properties based on both budget and characteristics to enhance productivity.

#### 4.6.2 Implementation
The `FilterCustomerCommand` and `FilterPropertyCommand` class extends the `Command` class. They are used to filter customers and properties, respectively.
The `filtercust` command allows the user to filter customers based on their budget and/or properties' characteristics they love. While the `filterprop` command allows the user to filter properties based on their budget and/or characteristics.
The commands expect at least one flag, either budget/price or characteristics, to be used as a filter.
When the filter command is inputted, the `FilterCustomerCommandParser` and `FilterPropertyCommandParser` class is used to parse the user input and create the respective `FilterCustomerCommand` or `FilterPropertyCommand` objects.
When these created command objects are executed by the `LogicManager`, the `FilterCustomerCommand#execute(Model model)` or `FilterCustomerCommand#execute(Model model)` methods are called. These methods will update the filtered customer or property list in the `model` which will eventually update the customers shown in the UI, and return a `CommandResult` object.

During this execution process, a new `BudgetAndTagsInRangePredicate` or `PriceAndTagsInRangePredicate` object which is used as a predicate to check whether a customer's budget is bigger and all the characteristics are desired by the customer or whether a property's price is lower and the property has all the characteristics, respectively.
All customers or properties will be tested using this `BudgetAndTagsInRangePredicate` or `PriceAndTagsInRangePredicate`. Customers or properties which satisfy this condition will be included into the `FilteredCustomerList` or `FilteredPropertyList` in the model.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `FilterCustomerCommand` is executed.
![FilterCustomerSequenceDiagram](images/FilterCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 4.6.3 Design Considerations
**Aspect: How the filter customer commands should relate to filter property commands:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `FilterCustomerCommand`  and `FilterPropertyCommand` inherit from the `Command` class and separated with each other.
    * Pros:
        * Both the `Customer` and `Property` classes have different fields that are exclusive to each other.
        * This reduces complexity of the system, and unexpected behaviours.
        * The inheritance of the `Command` class allows us to keep to the Command design pattern, to easily add more types of edit commands in the future, without having to change the existing code.
    * Cons:
        * More boilerplate code for each of the classes, which increases the size of the codebase.
* **Alternative 2:** A single `FilterCommand` class is used to edit both customer and property.
    * Cons:
        * Unnecessary complexity is introduced into the system.

**Aspect: How the filtered customers or properties should interact with the model:**
* We also decided for the filter commands to put the filtered customers or filtered properties in a different list (`FilteredCustomerList` and `FilteredPropertyList`), instead of removing the 'unused' customers and properties from the model.

### 4.7 Matching for Customers and Properties
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### 4.7.1 Motivation
The property agent may want to get all properties that satisfy the customers criteria or get all customers that want the properties characteristics. For example, the property agent want to get all properties that certain specified customer want and can afford.
Or, the property agent want to get all customers that might want to buy certain specified property.

#### 4.7.2 Implementation
The `MatchCustomerCommand` and `MatchPropertyCommand` classes extends the `Command` class.
They are used to match the details of a customer or property, respectively.
The command expects exactly one "Index" of the customer or property to be match, otherwise an error message will be displayed.
When the match command is inputted, the `MatchCustomerCommandParser` or `MatchPropertyCommandParser` classes are used to parse the user input and create the `MatchCustomerCommand` or `MatchPropertyCommand` objects respectively.
When these created command objects are executed by the `LogicManager`, the `MatchCustomerCommand#execute(Model model)` or `MatchProeprtyCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.
These methods will match the customer or property in the model, and return a `ComandResult` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `MatchCustomerCommand` is executed.
![MatchCustomerSequenceDiagram](images/MatchCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 4.7.3 Design Consideration

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* `MatchPropertyCommand` and `MatchCustomerCommand` are separate, and both inherit from the `Command` class.
    * Pros:
        * Allows the property agent to match only customers or properties.
        * The inheritance of the `Command` class allows us to keep to the Command design pattern, to easily add more types of edit commands in the future, without having to change the existing code.
    * Cons:
        * More code for each of the classes, which increases the size of the codebase
        * More commands for the property agent to remember
* *Alternative 2:* A single `MatchCommand` class is used to match both customers and properties.
    * Pros:
        * Lesser commands for the property agent to remember
    * Cons:
        * Unable to match only customers or properties without specify it which increase the complexity of the commands

### 4.8 Reset the application with `clear`
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### 4.8.1 Motivation
The property agent may want to clear the list of customers or properties to start from a clean slate.

#### 4.8.2 Implementation
The `ClearCommand` extends the `Command` class. It is used to clear the list of customers or properties.

#### 4.8.3 Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1:** `ClearPropertyCommand` and `ClearCustomerCommand` are separate, and both inherit from the `Command` class.
    * Pros:
        * Allows the property agent to clear only customers or properties.
        * The inheritance of the `Command` class allows us to keep to the Command design pattern, to easily add more types of edit commands in the future, without having to change the existing code.
    * Cons:
        * More boilerplate code for each of the classes, which increases the size of the codebase
        * More commands for the property agent to remember
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** A single `clear` class is used to clear both customers and properties.
    * Pros:
        * Less overhead to deal with
        * Lesser commands for the property agent to remember
    * Cons:
        * Unable to clear only customers or properties

### 4.9 Exit with a delay
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### 4.9.1 Motivation
The property agent should exit the application with a peace of mind. A delay is required for the property agent to read the exit message before the application closes.

#### 4.9.2 Implementation
The `ExitCommand` extends the `Command` class. It is used to close the application and display the goodbye message.
The following code is used to implement the delay. There are many ways to implement a timeout, but since we are using JavaFX. This is probably the simplest way to accomplish it.
```
PauseTransition delay = new PauseTransition(Duration.seconds(3));
delay.setOnFinished(e -> primaryStage.hide());
delay.play();
```

## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### A.1 Product scope

**Target user profile**:

- Property agents new to the real estate industry in Singapore
- Looking for a customer-property management tool

**Value proposition**:
This tool is for property agents who want to organise their client profiles with their corresponding properties. Property agents can boost their efficiency by seamlessly matching their clients with their desired properties.

## **Appendix C: Proposed enhancements**

### C.1 Improved GUI

#### C.1.1 Motivation:
Our current GUI is not as user-friendly as we would like it to be. A well-designed and aesthetic GUI provides a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier for users to navigate, access features, and perform tasks within the app. It can also lead to higher user satisfaction.

#### C.1.2 Implementation:
1. Update the color scheme to make the GUI more visually appealing. Use colors that resonate with our brand or that create a pleasant atmosphere.
2. Integrate relevant icons and imagery to represent different features and functions within the app, providing visual cues for users.
3. Add whitespace effectively to create a clean and organized layout and reduce visual clutter.
4. Add user guidance. Provide tooltips, hints, or tutorials for new users to help them get started and understand the app's features.

### C.2 Improved Error Messages

#### C.2.1 Motivation:
Some of our current error messages can be quite vague. As a user, this can be hard for them to decipher what is wrong. Upon receiving the error message, they may not know what is wrong. Knowing what they entered wrongly can lead to higher user satisfaction.

#### C.2.2 Implementation:
1. Update the error messages to be more specific. For example, if the user enters an invalid command, the error message should tell the user which part of the command is invalid, instead of just saying that the command is invalid.
2. Allow the `INDEX` for commands to accept very large numbers. Currently, the computer is unable to parse the number because it is too large, and PropertyMatch will mention that the command is invalid instead of mentioning that the number is too large.

### C.3 Importing client data

#### C.3.1 Motivation:
We realise that many property agents already have existing customers and properties. They may not want to manually enter all the data into the application. This feature will allow them to import their existing data into the application, saving them time and resources.

#### C.3.2 Implementation:
1. Add an `Import` button to the menu bar.
2. Create a file selection mechanism in which the user can import data from CSV files.
3. Parse and process the data in the file.
4. Validate the imported data to ensure it meets expected standards.
5. Add the data fields to PropertyMatch.
6. Provide clear feedback to the user about success/failure (success message or error message).
7. Implement error handling, logging, and security measures.

### C.4 Exporting client data

#### C.4.1 Motivation:
We realise that many property agents may want to export their existing data in PropertyMatch to other platforms. This feature will allow them to easily export their data into other platforms to perform other functions (such as data analysis) not supported on PropertyMatch.

#### C.4.2 Implementation:
1. Add an `Export` button to the menu bar.
2. Create a file selection mechanism in which the user can import data from CSV files.
3. Convert the data in the json files to CSV file.
4. Allow the user to name the CSV file.
5. Provide clear feedback to the user about success/failure (success message or error message).
6. Implement error handling, logging, and security measures.

### C.5 Ability to filter data less strictly

#### C.5.1 Motivation:
Right now, the `filter` commands require all characteristics to match the customer's or property's characteristics. This is too strict, and may not be useful for the property agent. This feature will allow the property agent to filter customers or properties based on a subset of characteristics.

#### C.5.2 Implementation:
1. Allow `filter` commands to take in an extra parameter called `loose`.
2. Add code to filter customers/properties that only match one of the criteria.
3. Implement error handling and logging.

### C.6 Budget for customer should be a range

#### C.6.1 Motivation:
Customers should be able to indicate their budget as a range instead of a set number. This is because customers may not have a fixed budget, and may be willing to pay more or less for a property.

#### C.6.2 Implementation:
1. Add code in `Budget` to have a range of values.
2. Add test cases to verify that `find`, `filter`, `match` still works with a budget range.
3. Implement error handling and logging.

## **Appendix D: Effort**

### D.1 Difficulty Level
Overall, the difficulty level of the tP was reasonable. PropertyMatch is evolved from AB3. Once we understood the inner workings of AB3 and how to add commands to the application, the process was relatively simple. However, there were still many things we had to pick up along the way when accomplishing the project.

### D.2 Challenges Faced
The main challenge came from having to manage two different kinds of entities -- customers and properties. Since AB3 only handled one entity, this meant that there was no model answer for handling two entities. We had to come up with our own design for how to handle two entities, and this took some time to figure out.

We also had to learn new technologies like Git and GitHub. Learning about good code practices as well as the forking workflow, all while working on a moderately large project was a challenge for us. It took us time to resolve some messy merge conflicts.

We were also faced with tight deadlines for the various milestones and submissions. This meant that we had to work efficiently and effectively to meet the deadlines.

### D.3 Effort Required
While some commands like `edit` and `list` were adapted from AB3, there were completely new commands like `find`, `match`, and `filter`.  The adapted commands were also heavily modified and separated into separate commands for separate entities, like `editcust` and `editprop`.

We also had to create multiple new classes for the `Property` entity. This also meant that we had to come up with suitable test cases for them as well.

Although seemingly small, we had to tinker with the regex of each command such that it accepts the proper user input that we need. This was a tedious process as we had to test each regex to ensure that it works as intended.

### D.4 Achievements of the project
We managed to implement all the features that we set out to do. We also managed to implement the `filter` command, which was not in the original plan. We also managed to implement the `match` command, which was a challenge for us.

We expanded our technical and non-technical proficiency, and we are proud of our wonderful journey!
