### Project: PropertyMatch

PropertyMatch is a desktop tool is for property agents who want to organise their client profiles with their corresponding properties. Property agents can boost their efficiency by seamlessly matching their clients with their desired properties.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

    * [#64](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/64)
    * What it does: It takes in a command in the format `addcust n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL b/BUDGET [c/CHARACTERISTIC]…​` and add that customer to the database.
    Where `NAME` represents the name, `PHONE` represents the phone number, `EMAIL` represents the email, `BUDGET` represents the budget, and `CHARACTERISTIC` represent the properties' characteristic wanted by the customer.

    * What it does: It takes a command in the format `filtercust [b/BUDGET] [c/CHARACTERISTIC]…​` and returns the customers who satisfy the predicate.
    Where `BUDGET` represents the minimum budget of the filtered customers and `CHARACTERISTIC` represents the minimum set of characteristics the filtered customers wanted.

    * What it does: It takes a command in the format `filterprop [pr/PRICE] [c/CHARACTERISTIC]…​` and returns the properties who satisfy the predicate.
      Where `PRICE` represents the minimum price of the filtered properties and `CHARACTERISTIC` represents the minimum set of characteristics the filtered properties wanted.
