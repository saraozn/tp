## Quick start
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
    * [Open up Terminal](#faq) on your computer.
    * Once the Terminal is open, type `java -version` and hit '**Enter/ Return**'.
    * The application should state your Java version as `11`.
    * If you do not see `11`, this [link](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) (external link to Oracle) provides a step-by-step installation guide for Java `11`.

2. Download the latest `propertymatch.jar` from our [releases page](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/releases). After clicking into the release page, scroll down slightly until you reach the Assets section of the page. This section should look like this:<br>
<br>![Release page](images/user-guide/ReleasePage.png)

3. Simply click on `propertymatch.jar`, and PropertyMatch should begin automatically downloading on your computer!

4. Copy the `propertymatch.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for PropertyMatch. All data will be created and stored in that folder. If you are unsure where to place the folder, go to your desktop and create a folder. You can then copy the `propertymatch.jar` file into the folder you just created.

5. Open the folder and double-click on `propertymatch.jar` to open PropertyMatch. If this does not work, please [open up the terminal](#faq) on your computer and type in `java -jar propertymatch.jar` to start the application.

6. An app similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note that the app already contains some sample data.<br>
<br> ![startUi](images/startUi.png)

Congratulations! PropertyMatch is now set up and ready to work on your system.

If you encounter any problems during the setup process, please check out the FAQ section of this guide, which hopefully contains some information that can help you diagnose your issue.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

**:exclamation: Caution (for advanced users):**<br>
* On first launch, PropertyMatch will create a few files that have the extension `.json` in its *home directory*. These files are used
  by PropertyMatch to store its data. <br>
* **Edit these at your own risk**, as PropertyMatch will start with an empty [database](#glossary) if it detects any
  error in the formatting of the data in these files.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interface Layout
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you launch PropertyMatch, PropertyMatch will appear on your screen as a window. Let's take a look at the 5 different components
that make up this window.

![UserInterface](images/user-guide/UserInterface.png)

### 1. Menu Bar

The Menu Bar is your command center, allowing you to exit the application and look for the link to our user guide.

### 2. Command Input and Output Boxes

These boxes are located at the top section of the window.<br><br>
![CommandBox](images/user-guide/CommandBox.png)<br><br>
The **command input box** is located where the placeholder text `Enter command here...` is.<br>
Clicking on it will allow you to type commands for PropertyMatch to execute.

The **command output box** is located directly beneath the **command input box**. Upon execution of any command, PropertyMatch will
display some information regarding the command, regardless of whether the command is successfully or not successfully executed.
In the image above, it is displaying the message "Listed all customers", the message shown after successfully executing
the [List Customers Command](#listing-all-customers-listcust).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* If a command is not successfully executed, the text within the command input box will turn <span style="color:red">red</span>.
</div>

Here are some commands you can test to start with. Try it out by copy and pasting in the command input box!

<img src="images/user-guide/CustomerList.png" width="300" /><br><br>
The customer list displays information regarding customers who are currently stored in PropertyMatch's database.

Note that it might not be showing *all* the customers in the database all the time (check out the [FAQ](#faq) for more information).

You can also filter and modify the customer list using the commands given in the [Features](#features) section below.

### 4. Property List

You can find the property list located at the right section of the window.<br><br>
<img src="images/user-guide/PropertyList.png" width="300" /><br><br>

You can also filter and modify the property list using the commands given in the [Features](#features) section below.

### 5. Help Window

This will appear as a separate window.
![Help Window](images/user-guide/HelpWindow.png)

The __help window__ displays a link to PropertyMatch's User Guide, which is the online version of this document.

It appears when you execute the [Help Command](#viewing-help-help).

## Features
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

PropertyMatch's features are mostly in the form of commands you can input into the [command input box](#1-command-input-and-output-boxes). We will now go into the details about each feature of PropertyMatch.
If you just want a quick summary of all the feature PropertyMatch has, do take a look at the [command summary](#command-summary) section.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the [parameters](#glossary) to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [c/CHARACTERISTIC]` can be used as `n/Tim Cook c/smart` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/CHARACTERISTIC]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `c/smart`, `c/smart c/rich` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</div>

Examples:
* `addprop n/Aqua Heights a/195 Paya Lebar 3 #18-32 p/91135235 pr/700000` adds a property with all the relevant details and no characteristics

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:bulb: Tip:**<br>
* Similar to adding a customer, ensure that you have typed the command accurately with **all** the compulsory [parameters](#glossary) present. (refer to the example commands above)<br>
* The characteristics are also optional. If it is not set, the characteristics field will be empty.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* `INDEX` can start with 0, i.e. inputting `matchcust 02` or `matchcust 0002` matches the second customer in the customer list to potential properties.

</div>

Examples:
* `matchcust 1`
* `matchcust 10`

A message in the [output box](#2-command-input-and-output-boxes) similar to the one below should appear when you have successfully matched your customers!

| Command Line Interface (CLI) | A text-based way to interact with a computer or software by typing commands into a command prompt. Instead of using buttons and icons, you enter commands to perform tasks.                                                                                                                                                |
| Parameter                    | Think of parameters like customizing your command. If you're telling someone to bake a cake, the flavor, size, and frosting type are your parameters. In PropertyMatch commands, parameters are the details you provide to make the command do exactly what you need. They're like the specific settings for your command. |
| Database                     | A database is like a digital filing cabinet where we store and organize information for easy access and management. It's a structured collection of data, simplifying how we keep things in order.                                                                                                                         |
