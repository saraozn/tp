## Interface Layout
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you launch PropertyMatch, PropertyMatch will appear on your screen as a window. Let's take a look at the 5 different components
that make up this window.

![UserInterface](images/user-guide/UserInterface.png)

### 1. Menu Bar
The Menu Bar is your command center, allowing you to exit the application and look for the link to our user guide.

### 2. Command Input and Output Boxes
These boxes are located at the top section of the window.<br><br>
![CommandBox](images/user-guide/CommandBox.png)<br><br>
The **command input box** is located where the placeholder text `Enter command here...` is.<br>
Clicking on it will allow you to type commands for PropertyMatch to execute.

The **command output box** is located directly beneath the **command input box**. Upon execution of any command, PropertyMatch will
display some information regarding the command, regardless of whether the command is successfully or not successfully executed.
In the image above, it is displaying the message "Listed all customers", the message shown after successfully executing
the [List Customers Command](#listing-all-customers-listcust).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:information_source: Note:**
* If a command is not successfully executed, the text within the command input box will turn <span style="color:red">red</span>.
</div>

Here are some commands you can test to start with.

* **`listcust`** : Lists all customers in the database.

* **`addcust n/ Tim Cook p/91234567 e/cook@apple.com b/2500000 c/bright c/sunny`** :
  Adds a customer named "Tim Cook" with a specified phone number and email to the database.
  This customer has a specified budget, and desired characteristics for the property he wants to buy.

* **`delcust 1`** : Deletes a customer at index 1 of the [customer list](#2-customer-list) from the database.

* **`help`** : Displays a help window.

* **`exit`** : Exits the application.

You can refer to the [Features](#features) below for the details of each command.

### 3. Customer List
You can find the customer list located at the left section of the window.<br><br>
<img src="images/user-guide/CustomerList.png" width="300" /><br><br>
The customer list displays information regarding customers who are currently stored in PropertyMatch's database.

Note that it might not be showing *all* the customers in the database all the time (check out the [FAQ](#faq) for more information).

You can also filter and modify the customer list using the commands given in the [Features](#features) section below.

### 4. Property List
You can find the property list located at the right section of the window.<br><br>
<img src="images/user-guide/PropertyList.png" width="300" /><br><br>
The property list displays information regarding properties that are currently stored in PropertyMatch's database.

Note that it might not be showing *all* the properties in the database all the time (check out the [FAQ](#faq) for more information).

You can also filter and modify the property list using the commands given in the [Features](#features) section below.

### 5. Help Window
This will appear as a separate window.
![Help Window](images/user-guide/HelpWindow.png)
The __help window__ displays a link to PropertyMatch's User Guide, which is the online version of this document. :)

It appears when you execute the [Help Command](#viewing-help-help).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
    * The method to check the Java version you use will be different for every operating system.
        * **Windows** users: <br>
          Click on the '**Windows**' key and search for '**Command Prompt**' <br>
        * **Mac** users: <br>
          Click on '**F4**' and search for '**Terminal**'
        * **Linux** users: <br>
          Click on '**Ctrl**' + '**Alt**' + '**T**' keys simultaneously
    * Once the application is open, type `java -version` and hit '**Enter/ Return**'.
    * The application should state your Java version as `11`.

    * If you do not see `11`, this [link](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) (external link to Oracle) provides a step-by-step installation guide for Java `11`.

2. Download the latest `propertymatch.jar` from our [releases page](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/releases). After clicking into the release page, scroll down slightly until you reach the Assets section of the page. This section should look like this:<br>
   ![Release page](images/user-guide/ReleasePage.png)

3. Simply click on `propertymatch.jar`, and PropertyMatch should begin automatically downloading on your computer!

4. Copy the `propertymatch.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for PropertyMatch. All data will be created and stored in that folder. If you are unsure where to place the folder, go to your desktop and create a folder. You can then copy the `propertymatch.jar` file into the folder you just created.

5. Open the folder and double-click on `propertymatch.jar` to open PropertyMatch. If this does not work, please open up the terminal on your computer and type in `java -jar propertymatch.jar` to start the application.
   
6. A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note that the app already contains some sample data.<br>
   ![startUi](images/startUi.png)

Congratulations! PropertyMatch is now set up and ready to work on your system.

If you encounter any problems during the setup process, please check out the FAQ section of this guide, which hopefully contains some information that can help you diagnose your issue.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

**:exclamation: Caution (for advanced users):**
* On first launch, PropertyMatch will create a few files that have the extension `.json` in its *home directory*. These files are used
by PropertyMatch to store its data. 
* **Edit these at your own risk**, as PropertyMatch will start with an empty database if it detects any
error in the formatting of the data in these files.
</div>
<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

PropertyMatch's features are mostly in the form of commands you can input into the [command input box](#1-command-input-and-output-boxes). We will now go into the details about each feature of PropertyMatch.
If you just want a quick summary of all the feature PropertyMatch has, do take a look at the [command summary](#command-summary) section.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [c/CHARACTERISTIC]` can be used as `n/Tim Cook c/smart` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/CHARACTERISTIC]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `c/smart`, `c/smart c/rich` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

**Q**: How do I install Java 11?<br>
**A**: Follow this [link](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) for steps to download Java 11.

**Q**: Why is PropertyMatch not displaying all customers/properties in the database?<br>
**A**:  It's possible that the application may not show all customers/properties all the time due to specific commands like [filtering](#filter-commands), [finding](#finding-commands), or [matching](#match-commands) that have been executed. If you're encountering this issue, consider using the [list commands](#list-commands) to ensure you're viewing the complete list.

**A**: We are sad to see you go 🙁 PropertyMatch is not installed onto your hard drive, so you only need to delete the folder that contains propertymatch.jar (that is, the home folder of PropertyMatch).

**Q**: Do I need an active internet connection to use PropertyMatch?<br>
**A**: No, PropertyMatch is a standalone application that does not require an internet connection to function. However, you'll need an internet connection to download it to your machine.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
